Hello there

for all animations the 1st, 3rd and 5th are idle sprites, while the rest are walking in respective direction. 
First 2 rows are walking downwards, 3rd and 4th are walking top, 5th and 6th are walking side. 

For the car, each is with a certain 32x32 based grid. For example the horizontal cars are 96x96 px, the corner is 
128x96 px and the top/down facing cars are 64x96 px. 

Best of luck and thanks for buying this pack! 
If you have any questions or spot any visual bugs or issues please let me know.
